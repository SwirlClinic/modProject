We did a couple of takes for the video, and we submitted our best one. However,
there were a couple of things that we would like to clarify:

0:39 - The "delete" query is actually an update query that stops the user
       from being able to login again (by setting an attribute named isdeleted
       to true). All content for the user is kept on the website. We do use
       delete queries however for un-favoriting posts and unfollowing users.
3:38 - There were actually 4 indexes that contributed to the speed up mentioned
       in the video (from 2 minutes to .250 seconds). These indexes can be found
       in the report.
4:33 - The search on that page is actually searching for the title of the post
       and the first column in the table represents the title of the post (not
       the title of the game).
