# Instructions for How to Run data_generation.py

If you don't have Python 2:

The easiest way to get Python 2 with the necessary
dependencies to run the program is by going to
https://www.continuum.io/downloads and downloading
Anaconda for Python 2.7. DO NOT download Anaconda for
Python 3. This will likely cause the program to run
incorrectly.

If you already have Python 2 or if you download Anaconda
and the pandas dependency isn't working:

Go to the console and type in 'pip install pandas'. You
may have to use sudo in front of that depending on your
system permissions (and if you are on linux). If you
don't have pip installed, then download the python
script from the following link, run the python script
(which should install pip), and try the command again:
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

You know the script has run successfully if you
see a bunch of csv files with the names of the tables
they should be inserted in.

If you have any issues getting the code to run after
all of the steps listed above, please feel free to
